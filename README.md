# Calculator App
A basic calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app performs standard arithmetic operations and provides a simple, intuitive interface.

## Features:
- Basic Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear Function: Allows users to reset the input for a new calculation.
- Keyboard Support: Users can interact with the calculator using keyboard inputs.
- Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes for usability on desktop and mobile.
## Technologies Used:
- HTML: Structures the calculator interface.
- CSS: Provides styling and layout for a clean, user-friendly design.
- JavaScript: Implements the calculator functionality and handles user interactions.
## Functionality:
## Arithmetic Operations
- The app handles arithmetic operations using JavaScript event listeners on each button. When a user clicks a number or operator, JavaScript captures the input and displays it on the screen.
## Display and Input Management
- Number and Operator Input: JavaScript manages each button's input and updates the display accordingly. This includes ensuring operators aren’t misused (e.g., preventing multiple consecutive operators).
- Evaluation: When the equals (=) button is clicked, the app evaluates the expression using JavaScript’s eval() function, which calculates the result based on the input string.
- Clear Function: The "Clear" button resets the display and internal data, allowing users to start fresh.

## Keyboard Support
- JavaScript adds event listeners for keyboard inputs, letting users type numbers and operators directly. This improves accessibility and provides an alternative to button clicks.
